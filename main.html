	<p>My intro to Git and colab helped me understand how developers manage versions of their projects, collaborate with teams, and contribute to open-source repositories efficiently. By learning Git, I can track changes, create branches, and merge code, while colab makes it easier to share and experiment with ideas in real time.</p>
